# textEdit_ifYouDare


## Description
This is a refactor of code for a text editor. Starter code was provided to me as a student in a Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The end result is a text editor that allows plaintext and code to be written in it and stored for later access. The app also functions as a Progressive Web Application, which can be installed on user's computer and accessed without an internet connection.

## Credits
Alistair Rowden, a tutor, assisted me in some issues with package.json scripts and icons.

JD Tadlock, my course intructor, found the solution to my icon hashing issues with the fingerprints property in the webpack.config.

ChatGPT provided assistance in understanding more about PWA and their setup, particularly in regard to service workers. I was out of town for a wedding and missed parts of our classes covering PWAs, and recordings are nice but don't let you ask questions, so I leaned pretty heavily on ChatGPT's ability to answer questions for this project.

I referenced [this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48839338/which-icon-sizes-are-required-for-progressive-web-apps-pwa-as-of-q1-2018) article for icon sizes in the webpack.config, and [this webdevetc](https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/javascript/webpack/guide-to-webpack-css-style-loader/) article for style loader and css loader info in the webpack.config. Those loaders are copied from that page and pasted into my code.
