WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
I think it does this?

I do see an error about the service worker, but the service worker seems to be working so I'm not sure what that is.

WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
It downloads, user has to move it to desktop though. Don't think I can change that through my code.
